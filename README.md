# browsi
A small python web browser based on the python tkinter module. 
Don't expect this to be a fully modern web browser, it currently can't even follow links (a harder task than one might expect).

### FEATURES:
* relatively small
* simple
* built in python, so it _should_ work on most platforms

### TO DOWNLOAD & INSTALL
you should be able to run the "brwsi.py" file after installing a recent version of python. Tkinter needs to be installed for it to work correctly, but don't worry, it's included with the default install
