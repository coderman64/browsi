{"name":"Browsi","tagline":"a small python-based web browser using the tk text widget","body":"# browsi\r\nBrowsi is a small python web browser based on the python tkinter module. \r\nDon't expect this to be a modern web browser, it currently can't even follow links (a harder task than one might expect). It doesn't advertise \"full HTML compatibility\" or anything. At this point it is just a project that may, at some point, become a browser that you could easily go into the code and change.\r\n\r\n### FEATURES:\r\n* relatively small\r\n* simple\r\n* built in python, so it _should_ work on most platforms (I haven't tested it on anything but Windows)\r\n* you can now search from the URL bar\r\n\r\n### TO DOWNLOAD & INSTALL\r\nyou should be able to run the \"brwsi.py\" file after installing a recent (3.x) version of python. Tkinter needs to be installed for it to work correctly, but don't worry, it's usually included with the default python packages.\r\n\r\n###working on:\r\n* html rendering is usually incorrect\r\n* little to no css\r\n* no tabbed browsing\r\n* links are a work in progress\r\n* some forms will show up, but won't work\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
